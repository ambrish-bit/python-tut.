#  variable is like a container or box in whic we are store information and use it in our progrram
#  it means irstly we declare any vale bu any specific name and the we use that specific name to find that data which is declared.
# we declare the valur using '=' (equals to)
# eg:-

name='Nitish'  # here's name is the variable which declare value
print(name)



a=5
b=6
print(a+b) # here's a and b is the variable which declare value


# dynamic typing --> it means how we declare the value
#  in the python we don't need to declare the value using data types it can find the data type by itself

# eg:- int a = 5  (it is wrong to declare any value)

# Dynamic typing
a=5


# dynamic binding
# it means once we declare any data type then we can change according to the needs


# Static bynding
#  it maeans once we declare any data types then we cannot change 

# python supports dynamic bynding where another language supports staticc bynding


# <> we can declare the value like that too
a,b,c = 2,4,6
print(a,b,c)

a=b=c=5
print(a,b,c)


# Snippit
# small our compact code is called or said to be snippit
