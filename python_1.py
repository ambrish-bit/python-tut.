print('Hello World')
print(7)
print(True)
print(7.9)

# it can print many different funtion at a time likes
print('Aman',7.5,1,True)

# int the python there's already space funtion which is used by keyword sep=' '
# if we want to put another things at the place of space then we can do that
# using sep='/' or sep='_' or sep=','   as like that whatever we want we can change accourding to our needs

# here's a example:-
print('Aman',True,8.2,9,sep='/')
print('Aman',True,8.2,9,sep='_')

# if we want to print any argument in a single line (if we print two values in seprete line) then
# we have to use end=' '
# eg :-

print('Hello')
print('World')

# this code will give the output in two different line the what we can do for print both argument in a single line is

print('Hello',end=' ')
print('World!')
